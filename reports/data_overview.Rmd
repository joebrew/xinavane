# Exploration

## Absences  


Absenteeism data spans from `r format(min(ab$date, na.rm = TRUE), '%B %d, %Y')` until `r format(max(ab$date, na.rm = TRUE), '%B %d, %Y')`. On average, there are `r ab %>% group_by(date) %>% tally %>% summarise(mean(n)) %>% as.numeric() %>% round` absences per day.  Though there appears to be some longer-term variation in the below chart, it's clear that there is annual (and even sub-annual) seasonality.

```{r}
temp <- ab %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  tally
ggplot(data = temp, 
       aes(x = date, y = n)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth() +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Absences') +
  ggtitle('Crude worker absences')
```

## Adjustment for worker days  

Crude absence data is relatively useless, given that it doesn't take into account the number of workers "susceptible" of absence on any given day (ie, the number of workers who were _supposed_ to work).  This explains why there are much fewer absences at certain times (Sunday) relative to others.

```{r}
temp <- ab %>%
  mutate(dow = weekdays(date)) %>%
  group_by(dow) %>%
  tally %>%
  filter(!is.na(dow))
temp <- temp[c(2,6,7,5,1,3,4),]
temp$dow <- factor(temp$dow, levels = temp$dow)

ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = dow,
           y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', alpha = 0.6, fill = 'darkblue') +
  xlab('Day of week') +
  ylab('Cumulative absences') +
  ggtitle('Crude absences by day of week') 
```

To account for the above issues, we can instead calculate an _absenteeism rate_, taking into account the employment beginning and end dates, leave statuses and working schedule of all the workers, based on (a) their days designated as "off", (b) their company entry date, and (c) their last payment date. Note, because this method does not take into account the fact that some workers go through periods of inactivity between their company entry date and last payment date (ie, seasonal workers), we have to assume "activity" during the entirety of a worker's period of observation. This has the effect of inflating our person-time at risk (and, by extension, deflating our absenteeism rate estimates).

Essentially, we calculate the number of eligible workers for each day (the denominator in our rate). The result looks like this:

```{r}

# # Write spreadsheets for laia (requested on 2016-04-13)
# if(!dir.exists('~/Desktop/magude')){
#   dir.create('~/Desktop/magude')
# }
# dd <- getwd()
# setwd('~/Desktop/magude')
# laia <- df
# write_csv(df, 'xinavane_worker_absences_and_presences.csv')
# setwd(dd)
# 
# rm(x, dd)
# # ALTERNATIVE, LESS USEFUL APPROACH
# # (for compatibility only)
# # Create a dataframe of every day
# df <- data.frame(
#   date = seq(min(ab$date, na.rm = TRUE),
#              max(ab$date, na.rm = TRUE),
#              by = 1))
# # Get day of week
# df$dow <- weekdays(df$date)
# 
# # Loop through each date, getting eligible workers
# df$eligibles <- NA
# for (i in 1:nrow(df)){
#   df$eligibles[i] <- 
#     nrow(workers[workers$company_entry_date <= df$date[i] &
#                    workers$days_off != df$dow[i],])
# }
# 


# Make "date" be the first day of the month
df$date <- df$month_start


temp <- df %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(eligibles),
            absences = sum(absences)) %>%
  mutate( p = absences / n * 100)
temp_g <- gather(temp, key, value, n:absences)
temp_g$key <-
  ifelse(temp_g$key == 'absences', 'Worker absence',
         ifelse(temp_g$key == 'n', 'Eligible worker-day',
                NA))
temp_g$key <-
  factor(temp_g$key, levels = rev(unique(temp_g$key)))

# Add a line for mda
temp_g$mda <- temp_g$date >= as.Date('2016-01-18')
temp$mda <- temp$date >= as.Date('2016-01-18')
# ggplot(data = temp_g,
#        aes(x = date, y = value, group = key, fill = key)) +
#   geom_area() +
#   xlab('Date') +
#   ylab('Number of eligible workers') +
#   ggtitle('Worker scheduling')

ggplot(data = temp) +
  geom_area(aes(x = date, y = n), fill = 'darkblue', alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_area(aes(x = date, y = absences), fill = 'darkorange', alpha = 0.6) +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Worker-days') +
  labs(title = 'Absences (orange) and worker-days observed (blue)',
       subtitle = '(aggregated to monthly level)')
```


## Absenteeism rate  


### All cause absences


The absenteeism rate is calculated by dividing the number of worker-absences per day over the number of worker-days on the schedule (ie, those who were _supposed_ to work that day).  Over time, absenteeism at Xinavane appears like this.



```{r}
# Make an mda dataframe for labeling
mda <- data.frame(date = as.Date('2016-01-18'),
                  mda = 'MDA',
                  y = 8)

ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = date, y = p)) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.6, fill = 'darkorange') +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Absenteeism rate (%)') +
  labs(title = 'Absenteeism rate during period of observation',
          subtitle = '(all causes)') +
  # geom_smooth() +
  geom_vline(data = mda, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(date)),
             alpha = 0.7,
             lty = 3) +
  geom_label(data = mda,
             aes(x = date,
                 y = y,
                 label = mda))
```

The daily average absenteeism rate (adjusted for worker eligibility) is `r round(weighted.mean(temp$p, temp$n), digits = 2)`%.  

### Sickness only absences

```{r}
temp <- df %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(eligibles),
            absences = sum(sick_absences)) %>%
  mutate( p = absences / n * 100)
temp_g <- gather(temp, key, value, n:absences)
temp_g$key <-
  ifelse(temp_g$key == 'absences', 'Worker absence',
         ifelse(temp_g$key == 'n', 'Eligible worker-day',
                NA))
temp_g$key <-
  factor(temp_g$key, levels = rev(unique(temp_g$key)))

# Add a line for mda
temp_g$mda <- temp_g$date >= as.Date('2016-01-18')
temp$mda <- temp$date >= as.Date('2016-01-18')

ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = date, y = p)) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.6, fill = 'darkorange') +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Absenteeism rate (%)') +
  labs(title = 'Absenteeism rate during period of observation',
          subtitle = '(marked as sickness only)') +
  # geom_smooth() +
  geom_vline(data = mda, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(date)),
             alpha = 0.7,
             lty = 3) +
  geom_label(data = mda,
             aes(x = date,
                 y = y,
                 label = mda))
```

The daily average sickness-atributible absenteeism rate (adjusted for worker eligibility) is `r round(weighted.mean(temp$p, temp$n), digits = 2)`%.  

## Absenteeism rate by worker type  

Agricultural workers have significantly higher absenteeism than those that work in the factory or in general services.  

```{r}
temp <- df %>%
  group_by(date, worker_type) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(eligibles),
            absences = sum(absences)) %>%
  mutate( p = absences / n * 100)

# Add a line for mda
temp$mda <- temp$date >= as.Date('2016-01-18')

cols <- brewer.pal(n = length(unique(temp$worker_type)), 'Spectral')

ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = date, y = p)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.3, aes(group = worker_type, color = worker_type)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, aes(group = worker_type, color = worker_type)) +
  geom_smooth(alpha = 0.1, aes(group = worker_type, color = worker_type)) +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Absenteeism rate') +
  scale_color_manual(values = cols,
                     name = 'Worker type') +
  ggtitle('Worker absenteeism by type') +
    geom_vline(data = mda, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(date)),
             alpha = 0.7,
             lty = 3) +
  geom_label(data = mda,
             aes(x = date,
                 y = y,
                 label = mda))
if(!dir.exists('~/Desktop/visuals')){
  dir.create('~/Desktop/visuals')
}

```


## Age  

To the extent that absenteeism is confounded with health (which is in turn affected by age), it's important to note the age of workers.

```{r}
temp <- workers
temp$age <- as.numeric((Sys.Date() - temp$date_of_birth) / 365.25)
ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = age)) +
  geom_density(fill = 'darkblue', alpha = 0.6) +
  xlab('Age (years)') +
  ylab('Density') +
  ggtitle('Age distribution of Xinavane workers')
```

It's worthwhile to note that the age of workers varies significantly by _type_:

```{r}
temp <- temp[!is.na(temp$type),]
ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = type, 
           y = age)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4, fill = 'darkorange') +
  xlab('Worker type') +
  ylab('Age of workers (years)') +
  ggtitle('Distribution of worker age by type')
```

Worker age also varies significantly by category:  

```{r}
temp <- temp[!is.na(temp$category),]
ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = category, 
           y = age)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4, fill = 'darkorange') +
  xlab('Worker category') +
  ylab('Age of workers (years)') +
  ggtitle('Distribution of worker age by category')
```

As well as by work location:

```{r}
temp <- temp[!is.na(temp$category),]
ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = worker_type, 
           y = age)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4, fill = 'darkorange') +
  xlab('Worker category') +
  ylab('Age of workers (years)') +
  ggtitle('Distribution of worker age by category')
```


Age appears to be associated, albeit non-linearly, with absenteeism.

```{r}
temp <- df %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric((Sys.Date() - date_of_birth) / 365.25)) %>%
  group_by(number) %>%
  summarise(absenteeism_rate = sum(absences) / sum(eligibles) * 100,
            age = first(age)) %>%
  filter(age <= 70)

ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = age, y = absenteeism_rate)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  xlab('Age') +
  ylab('Absenteeism rate') +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle('Age and absenteeism')
```

When we group by decade, a trend becomes slightly more apparent:

```{r}
temp$age_group <- factor(floor(temp$age / 10) * 10)

ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = age_group, 
           y = absenteeism_rate)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4, fill = 'darkorange') +
  xlab('Age group (by decade)') +
  ylab('Absenteeism rate') +
  ggtitle('Absenteeism rate by age (grouped)')


```

## Gender  

The ratio of males to females at Xinavane is greater than 2 to 1:

```{r}
ggplot(data = workers[!is.na(workers$gender),], aes(gender)) +
  geom_bar(fill = 'darkblue', alpha = 0.6) +
  xlab('Gender') +
  ylab('Workers') +
  ggtitle('Distribution of worker gender')
```



```{r}
temp <- df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(gender)) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
    summarise(n = sum(eligibles),
            absences = sum(absences)) %>%
  mutate( p = absences / n * 100)

ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = gender, y = p)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',
           color = 'black',
           fill = 'darkorange',
           alpha = 0.6) +
  xlab('Gender') +
  ylab('Absenteeism rate') +
  ggtitle('Absenteeism rate by gender') +
  geom_label(aes(label = paste0(round(p, digits = 2), '%')))
```

If we examine absences over time by gender, trends are apparent.

```{r}
temp <- df %>%
  group_by(date, gender) %>%
    summarise(n = sum(eligibles),
            absences = sum(absences)) %>%
  mutate( p = absences / n * 100)

cols <- c('blue', 'red')
ggplot(data = temp,
       aes(x = date, y = p, group = gender, color = gender)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(alpha = 0.1) +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Absenteeism rate') +
  scale_color_manual(values = cols,
                     name = 'Gender') +
  ggtitle('Worker absenteeism by gender')

```

## Marital status  

Either (a) the facility has a highly unusual subset of single Mozambicans or (b) marriage is underreported in the data:  

```{r}
ggplot(data = workers[!is.na(workers$marital_status),], aes(marital_status)) +
  geom_bar(fill = 'darkblue', alpha = 0.6) +
  xlab('Marital status') +
  ylab('Workers') +
  ggtitle('Distribution of worker marital status')
```
